X11 Projects
You will notice that one, ten or a thousand radi button will not change your need for programming, only need for screen 
space; or smaller buttons. Or you need sliders, or a new window, try a webcam, draw a line that follows your hand as 
you wave at the camera if you can. I probably cannot. These two files are built on projects that took a little time, a 
day or two. The projects worked as promised as well.
